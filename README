## What is this?
A mini-mysql instance manager. I use this for running multiple instances of MySQL or MariaDB. Mostly to test replication and new features.

## What can it do?
mydba, through the script my, provides a simple insterface to build a basic config, then use that to install and start a server. Servers are differentiated by port number and an instance name of your choosing. mydba also now supports multiple different versions, as the basdir variable is written to each config.

## Install
put the my script in a directory already in your $PATH variable, I typically use ~/bin

## Future Features
* Add support for GTID management for MariaDB 10.x
* Add replication cluster creation using multi-source replication and GTID in MariaDB 10.x
* Better output formatting.
* Allow safe (mysqld_safe) and unsafe (mysqld) daemon mode switching. Per Server? Per Cluster?
* Add LD_LIBRARY_PATH switching for your environment.
* Redo this in python/ruby/perl/lua ? Bash is certainly more portable.
