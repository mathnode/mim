## What is this?
A simple mysql instance manager. Mostly for testing features and running multiple instances of MySQL/MariaDB, even multiple versions.
Comes in handy when you need to test replication features for example, quickly.


## How do I use it?
Define the following variables:
* export DBHOME=/path/do/dir, an empty directory to be used for configs, templates, datadir by the 'my' script.
* export DBINSTDIR=/path/do/dir, a directory where you are keeping tar.gz files of Mysql or MariaDB
* Finally put the 'my' script somewhere that is in your $PATH variable. I normally used ~/bin


## Future features
* MySQL 5.6+ and MariaDB 10+ GTID management for testing failover.
* Client path switching
* LD_LIBRARY_path switching
* ... better documentation.
